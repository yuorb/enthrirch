"enthrirhc") is a tool that aims to make it easier to learn the New Ithkuil.

## Supported Platforms

> **Note**
>
> For macOS & iOS users: Open [En≈£rir√ß](https://yuorb.github.io/enthrirhc/) in Safari and install it as a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_app) instead. This project does not offer the source code for macOS & iOS, because the developer(@lomirus) has no macOS device to get the En≈£rir√ß adapted for, and after all, it's not a small amount of money to spend $99 per year to be an Apple Developer just in order to publish a free & open source App :P
